                            <p>With each new year we get a new version of Android, and this year it’s Android 14’s turn. So you can expect a major upgrade to your phone, with new features and potentially a new look, once Android 14  or Android Upside Down Cake as it’s codenamed  rolls out.</p>    
                       <p class="me" id="green">Many Samsung phones qualify for four years of operating system upgrades, but that policy only applies to recent handsets, which would have gotten Android 14 anyway; devices like the Samsung Galaxy S23 series, the Samsung Galaxy S22 series, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4, and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4.</p>

                        <p>Olivia Pratt-Korbel's murderer Thomas Cashman could have his 42-year prison sentence increased after complaints it was too lenient.

                            The Attorney General's office has the sentence "under consideration" after referrals from members of the public.
                            
                            The office has until 1 May - 28 days after Cashman's sentencing on 3 April - to decide whether to refer the complaint to the Court of Appeal.</p>
